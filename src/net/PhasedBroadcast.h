     * PROGRAMME
     * ---------
     *
     * For 0-indexed cycle counts and 0-indexed depths, tree depth = N.
     *
     * Iterations 0 to (N-1) are nodes at depth (it) passing down to nodes at depth (it + 1).
     * Action happens on all nodes at the end of iteration (N-1).
     * Iterations N to (2N-1) are nodes at depth (2N - it) passing up to nodes at depth (2N - it - 1).

    /**
     * PhasedBroadcast - a class to control the general process of communication between
     * all nodes over multiple iterations. By using a common interface, we can ensure that
     * communication happens asynchronously at a single point in each iteration - only one
     * communication from any node to any other node will be performed, giving efficient
     * performance.
     *
     * Communication uses a tree structure with a single top-level node, and a constant number of
     * children per node down the tree. All nodes at the same depth communicate on the same
     * iteration with nodes either above or below them (depending on the position through the
     * communication programme defined above). The class supports actions that have to be performed
     * before any communication begins, followed by potentially multiple, overlapping communication
     * stages between related nodes in each consecutive pair of depths in the tree. Communication
     * can be up the tree towards the topmost node, down the tree (beginning at the topmost node)
     * or both (down the tree then up). An action to be performed on all nodes, when communication
     * from top to bottom of the tree has been completed, is also supported.
     *
     * The class is called via the IteratedAction interface. Classes that use this interface should
     * derive from either PhasedBroadcastRegular (for communication that is to happen at regular
     * intervals) or PhasedBroadcastIrregular (for communication that is to happen at irregular
     * intervals). The derived class should override one or more virtual functions in the chosen
     * base class, and should perform communication using the templated
     * [SendTo|ReceiveFrom][Children|Parent] functions defined in this class.
     *
     * This class is made general using template parameters:
     *
     * initialAction = if true, an extra iteration occurs at the start of each broadcast cycle
     * splay = the number of consecutive iterations communication between a pair of nodes needs to
     *   go on for. Useful if the passed data is an array of variable length; one node can spend an
     *   iteration telling the other how many elements will be passed then the next iteration
     *   sending them.
     * ovrlp = the number of iterations where a node both receives and sends. overlap <= splay.
     * down = true if parents communicate to their child nodes in the pattern.
     * up = true if children communicate to their parent nodes in the pattern.
